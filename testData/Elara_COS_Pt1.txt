Date: 13th Moon, 1478 DR

Campaign: Curse of Strahd

Character: Elara, Half-Elf Rogue

Session Notes:

Entry 1: Arrival in Barovia

We arrived in Barovia under a sky perpetually shrouded in mist. The village is eerily quiet, and the townsfolk seem to live in constant fear. Our first stop was the Blood of the Vine Tavern. Met Ismark, who begged us to help his sister, Ireena, who has been targeted by the devil Strahd.

Entry 2: The Burgomaster's Mansion

Visited the Burgomaster's mansion. The place is fortified like a fortress. Ireena is as beautiful as she is defiant. She insists she won't leave until her father's body is properly buried. Agreed to escort them to the church.

Entry 3: Church of St. Andral

The church was a grim sight. Met Father Donavich, who seemed broken. His son, Doru, has been turned into a vampire spawn. Heart-wrenching moment - had to decide between helping the priest or putting Doru out of his misery. We chose mercy, and Doru is no more. Buried the Burgomaster as promised.

Entry 4: The Road to Vallaki

Left Barovia for Vallaki. The road is treacherous, and Strahd's presence is palpable. We were ambushed by wolves, seemingly under his command. Barely escaped with our lives. Need to stay vigilant.

Entry 5: Vallaki

Vallaki is different - more fortified, but the people are still afraid. Met the Baron, who is obsessed with keeping everyone "happy" through ridiculous festivals. Also encountered Lady Fiona Wachter, who hinted at a rebellion. Both seem dangerous in their own ways.

Entry 6: The Vistani Camp

Visited a Vistani camp outside Vallaki. The elder, Madam Eva, read our fortunes. She spoke of powerful artifacts and allies that could help us defeat Strahd. Mentioned a weapon of sunlight, a holy symbol, and a fallen ally who could rise again.

Entry 7: Old Bonegrinder

Investigated Old Bonegrinder, a windmill turned sinister. Discovered it was a den for hags who were baking pastries made from children's bones. We rescued as many as we could, but the hags escaped. This land is cursed in more ways than one.

Entry 8: Krezk and the Abbey of St. Markovia

Reached Krezk, a secluded village. The Abbot at the Abbey of St. Markovia is... unnerving. Claims to have a plan to end Strahd's reign but his methods are questionable. Spotted a flesh golem bride he’s creating for Strahd. Decided to tread carefully around him.

Entry 9: Argynvostholt

Found Argynvostholt, the ruined mansion of a dragon knight order. The ghost of the dragon Argynvost appeared, urging us to reclaim his skull from Castle Ravenloft. The mansion is haunted by revenants, but it feels like we have allies here.

Entry 10: Yester Hill

Visited Yester Hill, a druidic site. Faced off against crazed druids who worship Strahd. Destroyed a massive tree blight, but not before the druids summoned a vision of Strahd on his nightmare. It was a warning. He knows we're coming.

Entry 11: The Amber Temple

The Amber Temple was our most dangerous venture yet. Full of dark secrets and the promise of power. We resisted most temptations, but one of us (still not sure who) made a pact with a dark entity. Need to stay united and wary of betrayal.

Entry 12: Return to Barovia

Back in Barovia Village. The final showdown is near. We have the Sun Sword, the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, and have gained powerful allies. Strahd has invited us to dinner at Castle Ravenloft. It’s a trap, but we’re ready.

Personal Notes:

Strahd's attention is unnerving. He seems obsessed with Ireena. Must keep her safe.
Trust within the group is crucial. Temptations in this land are strong, and allies can quickly become enemies.
Keep an eye on the Abbot and Lady Wachter. Both have their own agendas.
Find and reclaim Argynvost’s skull. His spirit could be a powerful ally.
Next Steps:

Prepare for the dinner at Castle Ravenloft.
Secure all magical artifacts and ensure everyone is prepared.
Coordinate with allies in Vallaki and Krezk for potential support.
Stay vigilant and trust no one fully. Strahd’s influence is everywhere.
These notes encapsulate the harrowing journey Elara and her party have undertaken in their quest to free Barovia from Strahd's grip, highlighting key encounters and personal reflections.
