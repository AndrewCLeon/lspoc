Character: Elara, Half-Elf Rogue

Session Notes:

Entry 1: Journey to Chult

We received a desperate plea from Syndra Silvane, a former adventurer afflicted by a mysterious death curse. It is said to originate from the jungles of Chult. Our mission: find and destroy the source of the curse. Arrived in Port Nyanzaru, a bustling city full of exotic sights and sounds.

Entry 2: Port Nyanzaru

Met our guide, Eku, who claims to have knowledge of the jungle. Explored the city, gathering supplies and information. Participated in a dinosaur race – won a small fortune and earned the locals’ respect. Noted strange tattoos on some citizens, likely linked to the death curse.

Entry 3: Into the Jungle

Left the safety of the port, heading into the dense jungle. The heat and humidity are oppressive. Encountered our first real danger – a group of undead ambushed us. Barely managed to fend them off. Eku mentioned that the undead activity has increased recently.

Entry 4: Camp Vengeance

Reached Camp Vengeance, a fort held by the Order of the Gauntlet. The soldiers are struggling, besieged by disease and undead attacks. Helped them fend off a major assault, earning their gratitude. Captain Breakbone requested we deliver a message to Port Nyanzaru.

Entry 5: The Aldani Basin

Ventured deeper into the jungle. Came across the Aldani Basin, home to strange lobster-like creatures known as Aldani. They seemed peaceful but wary. Discovered an ancient shrine hidden nearby, full of traps and treasures. Found clues pointing towards the lost city of Omu.

Entry 6: Firefinger

Eku led us to Firefinger, a giant spire used by pterafolk. Scaling the spire was a challenge – the height and hostile creatures tested our resolve. Recovered an ancient map from the top, detailing routes to Omu. Lost some supplies in the process, need to be more cautious.

Entry 7: The Heart of Ubtao

Found the Heart of Ubtao, a floating earthmote shaped like a heart. Inside, a mad wizard named Valindra Shadowmantle was experimenting with necromancy. We struck a tenuous deal – she provided information about Omu in exchange for leaving her lair untouched.

Entry 8: Omu

Finally reached the lost city of Omu. The place is crawling with Yuan-ti and other dangers. Discovered shrines dedicated to the Nine Trickster Gods, each holding puzzles and trials. Collected several puzzle cubes needed to unlock the Tomb of the Nine Gods.

Entry 9: The Fane of the Night Serpent

Infiltrated the Yuan-ti temple, the Fane of the Night Serpent. Rescued several prisoners and disrupted their plans. Barely escaped with our lives. Learned that the Soulmonger, the source of the death curse, lies within the Tomb of the Nine Gods.

Entry 10: The Tomb of the Nine Gods

Entered the tomb, a labyrinth filled with deadly traps and powerful guardians. Solved complex puzzles and faced numerous challenges. Lost a companion to one of the traps – a stark reminder of the tomb’s dangers. Encountered the spirit of an ancient trickster god, who offered cryptic advice.

Entry 11: The Soulmonger

Reached the final chamber, where the Soulmonger is guarded by a powerful lich named Acererak. The battle was fierce, pushing us to our limits. Managed to destroy the Soulmonger, ending the death curse. Acererak escaped, vowing revenge.

Entry 12: Return to Port Nyanzaru

Returned to Port Nyanzaru as heroes. The death curse is lifted, and Syndra Silvane began to recover. The city celebrated our success. We received rewards and recognition from the Merchant Princes and other factions. Planning our next steps – the jungle still holds many secrets.

Personal Notes:

The jungle is unforgiving. Trusting Eku was a wise choice; her knowledge saved us many times.
The death curse was a harrowing experience, but we grew stronger as a team.
Acererak’s escape is troubling. We need to prepare for his inevitable return.
The Nine Trickster Gods were intriguing – their powers and stories warrant further investigation.
Next Steps:

Investigate other ancient ruins in Chult for additional clues and treasures.
Strengthen alliances with local factions for future expeditions.
Prepare for potential retaliation from Acererak and his minions.
Reflect on the journey and lessons learned to better face future challenges.
